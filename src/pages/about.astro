	<p>
		I'm a System Engineer from Dunedin, New Zealand, working in a Managed Service Provider. I enjoy
		turning complex problems into simple, beautiful knowledge articles.
	</p>
	<p>
		My job is to examine system behavior, identify issues, and devise solutions—sometimes from
		scratch. Moreover, I also provide advice on hardware and software to ensure a client’s computer
		system meets their needs.
